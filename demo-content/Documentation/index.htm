			<h3>Home page</h3>

            <p>Make a home page like in our demo is pretty simple. First, create a static page and choose 'Home page' template for this page. Than
            choose 'a static page' option for Front Page displays settings and choose your created static page:</p>
            <img src="images/bauhaus-1.png" width="775" height="514" alt="">
            <p>You are done!</p>

            <p>Among sections for home page are: <a href="#simpleslider">simple slider</a>, two sections to show "about us" information (content can be added via
            theme options page), unique grid with 6 items of custom content (content can be added via theme options page), <a href="#services">"Our Services" block</a>,
            <a href="#testimonials">block with testimonials</a>, <a href="#brands">block with brands/logotypes</a>, <a href="contact">block with a map and contact information</a>.
            All these blocks can be enabled/disabled via <a href="#options">theme options page</a> on "Home" page settings" tab.</p>

		</section>

        <section id="about" class="two">
            <h3>"About" page</h3>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>First of all create a page and choose template 'About Page'. Featured image will be added to the page header in the background. You should also
            add a title and subtitle (via metabox). Than add a title for "Our story" block and content for the left and the right columns (via metabox).</p>

            <p>Also, you can enable "Meet Our Team" block (explained below), "Our Partners" block (explained below) and block with Instagram images (<strong>you must
            activate 'Instagram Feed' plugin (free) to be able to use this block!</strong>)</p>

            <h4>"Meet Our Team"</h4>

            <p>The theme creates a new special user role called 'architector'. All users under this role will be shown in this block on 'About' page. So, first
            of all choose 'architector' role for some users and add an avatar and fill in their profession on their profiles:</p>

            <img src="images/bauhaus-6.png" width="628" height="449" alt="">

            <p>The number of slides which can be shown is unlimited. All published posts of Home Slides CPT will be shown in the slider. To hide a slide just
            draft related post.</p>

            <p>We recommend to use 'Intuitive Custom Post Order' plugin to reoder posts. Posts on the top will be shown first in the slider.</p>

            <img src="images/bauhaus-4.png" width="854" height="677" alt="">

            <p>So, you can display services on per post basis on the home page and/or on page with "Services" template and use different images in different
            places.</p>

            <p>Page with "Services" template is just a page with "Services Page" template chosen. This page displays prices (3 or 4) at the top of the page and

            <img src="images/bauhaus-9.png" width="742" height="184" alt="">

            <p>This option works for both section with brands on home page and section with brands on "About" page and turns all your brand images into
            black and white. We think, B&W logotypes look better :)</p>

        </section>

        <section id="options" class="two">

            shown!</strong>
            This is how Layout 1 looks like:</p>
            <img src="images/bauhaus-14.png" width="1087" height="207" alt="">
            <p>And this is how Layout 2 looks like:</p>

            <h3>Required and recommended plugins</h3>

            <p>There is some required and some recommended plugins. <strong>All the required plugins are bundled with the theme</strong> and only required plugins
            affect the basic functionality of the theme. Recommended plugins just add some additional functionality, they are not neccessary and some of them are not
            bundled with the theme. You can buy them or download for free (it depends on the particular plugin). 'Recommended' means that we tested how they
            work with the theme just to be sure that everything will be ok and we think that they can be useful in some particular situations.</p>

            <p>Some of the required plugins are paid and bundled with the theme, like 'Uni User Avatar', so you can use them with ease.</p>

            <h3>Demo content</h3>

            <p>You can find export file with demo content in the folder 'Demo content' within item's archive. First of all you have to activate 'Bauhaus' theme
            ('Bauhaus Child' is a betetr option, actually),
            then activate plugin 'Uni Custom Post Types and Taxonomies'. <strong>Otherwise, not
            all the information (especially custom post types and custom taxonomies) will be imported!</strong>. Than go to 'Tools' -> 'Import' admin menu and choose
            'WordPress' from the list. You will be asked to install 'WordPress Importer' plugin. Install it and activate. Now choose 'bauhaus.wordpress.2015-09-11.xml' file
            from your computer and click 'Upload file and import'. Follow the instructions.</p>

            <p>Now go to OptionTree -> Settings and paste the code from 'layout.txt' file and hit Import Layouts</p>

            <img src="images/bauhaus-16.png" width="1038" height="384" alt="">

            <p>Additionally you have to do a couple of things. First, assign menu in Appearance -> Menus and choose 'Home' page as front page of your website
            under Settings -> Reading admin menu.</p>

            <p>You are done!</p>

            <p><strong>The demo content doesn't contain images. It contains only general structure and texts.</strong></p>

            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Q: Why links to 'Home slides' or 'Brands' (or other custom post types) have been disappeared from the admin menu?</strong> <br>A: More likely it
                is because you have changed the name of the theme's folder. You have to keep it 'bauhaus' all the time! Another reason may be that you have created
                a child theme but haven't added line "Template: bauhaus" in the style.css of your child theme. Than just add such line and the problem is gone.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: How to change the favicon?</strong> <br>A: The theme uses 5 files with favicons for different resolutions/devices. They are: favicon.ico,
                favicon-16×16.png, favicon-32×32.png, apple-touch-icon-144×144.png, apple-touch-icon-152×152.png So, just change them, but keep the same file names.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: What is the proper way to customize your theme?</strong> <br>A: First, you should create a child theme. A sample of such child theme
                already is in item's archive. You can use it for your needs. Second, make all changes ONLY through your child theme. It is not a good idea to make
                changes in original theme's files because you won't be able to upgrade it. An additional information about managing a child theme
                <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">can be found here</a>.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: What is the proper way to upgrade the theme?</strong> <br>A: You have to completely replace all the old files. It is event better to
                just delete an entire folder of your current Bauhaus parent theme, then upload the new folder with the theme. Also, we might make a decision to add
                some functions to 'functions.php' file of the precreated child theme, so it is always a good idea to look what is new added in that file and compare
                what you have in your current child theme. Of course, if you are using a child theme.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: How to translate the theme on my language?</strong> <br>A: The theme translation files are located in 'languages' folder. Make a copy
                of en_GB.po, rename it to your lang tags, make a translation and save in to 'languages' folder. Also, you have to generate .mo file with the same name
                as your .po file. Save this file in to 'languages' folder too. You are done!</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Is this theme retina ready?</strong> <br>A: In general, yes! This theme uses icons of fontawesome font and they look nice on screens
                with any resolutions and/or pixels density. If it comes about thumbnails then you can use this plugin
                <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-retina-2x/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-retina-2x/</a>. Activate it, choose best suitable option for you,
                regenerate thumbnails (needed only at the first time!) and you are done! And remember to use only big and high quality images on your website!</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Can I auto update this theme from WP admin?</strong> <br>A: Yes, you can. All you need to do is to install special plugin
                "Envato WordPress Toolkit". Here is <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/envato-wordpress-toolkit-guide/">a detailed instruction</a> how to achieve
                that.</li>
